    "reasoning": "The solution fails to meet all three mandatory requirements. While it demonstrates good understanding of timing and dietary restrictions, it critically lacks: (1) a stated daily caloric total, (2) a macronutrient breakdown with specific numbers, and (3) exact portions for most meals. The vague 'Regular Meals' section with unquantified portions makes it impossible to verify whether the plan actually reaches 5000+ calories or maintains proper macronutrient ratios. The solution provides a framework but not the specific numerical data required by the mandatory criteria."

    "reasoning": "The solution violates the mandatory requirement for 'Meals with exact foods, portions, and timing.' While it provides excellent macro targets, protein distribution strategy, and general food recommendations, it stops short of delivering an actual 1-day meal plan. The task explicitly asks for a '1 day meal plan' with specific meals, but the solution only provides a framework and guidelines. The closing question 'Would you like a specific sample meal plan...' confirms the solution is incomplete - it should have included the sample meal plan rather than asking for it. This is a structural failure to meet the core deliverable."
