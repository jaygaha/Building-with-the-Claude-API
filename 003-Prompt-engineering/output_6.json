        "content": "The genealogy of modern subjectivity traces through Enlightenment rationalism and Romantic introspection, yet postcolonial theorists have demonstrated how Western epistemologies obscured non-European modes of selfhood. Drawing on Foucault's analysis of disciplinary power, scholars have examined how colonial institutions shaped consciousness across colonized populations, while simultaneously, feminist historiography has recovered women's intellectual contributions that traditional narratives rendered invisible. These intersecting genealogies reveal that the autonomous subject\u2014so central to liberal political theory\u2014emerges not as a universal category but as a historically contingent formation embedded in networks of power, knowledge production, and cultural representation. Contemporary work in affect theory further complicates this picture by questioning whether emotions and embodied experience can be recuperated outside the frameworks that have historically pathologized non-Western and non-masculine forms of being."

Validation on 10,000 held-out tiles demonstrated robust generalization with minimal overfitting (training loss: 0.087, validation loss: 0.094), outperforming baseline U-Net (91.2% mIoU) and SegNet (89.8% mIoU) architectures on identical datasets."

In anaerobic conditions, cells rely on glycolysis and fermentation to produce ATP, though these pathways generate significantly less energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration.
