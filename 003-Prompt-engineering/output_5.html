## KEY NUTRITIONAL NOTES

✅ **Carbohydrate Strategy:** 7.3g/kg bodyweight optimizes glycogen stores for marathon endurance

✅ **Protein Distribution:** ~18-38g per meal maintains muscle integrity during high-volume training

✅ **Timing:** Carb-heavy meals surrounding training windows maximize performance & recovery

✅ **Hydration Protocol:** 3.5-4L water daily + 500ml sports drink during training (electrolytes + 6% car</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements with precise daily caloric totals, detailed macronutrient breakdowns, and comprehensive meal listings with exact portions and timing across six eating occasions. The carbohydrate loading strategy (482g, 60.2% of calories) falls within the 55-65% target range. However, the hydration strategy criterion is only partially satisfied—while a hydration protocol is mentioned, it is incomplete and truncated, failing to provide the specific fluid intake recommendations throughout the day that were explicitly requested. The solution demonstrates strong nutritional planning and formatting but falls short on the secondary criterion due to the incomplete hydration guidance.</td>
