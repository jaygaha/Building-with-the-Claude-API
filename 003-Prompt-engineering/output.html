                <td class="criteria">• Meal plan contains exactly 1 day of meals with timing aligned to 7am training session<br>• Total daily calories meet high-endurance athlete needs (minimum 4500 calories)<br>• Carbohydrates comprise 60-70% of total calories with strategic pre/post-workout timing<br>• All meals respect vegetarian and dairy-free restrictions</td>
                <td class="output"><pre># Marathon Training Nutrition Plan (5000+ calorie day)

## Pre-Run Meal (5-6 hours before, ~2am)
- 2 cups cooked oatmeal with banana and almond butter
- 2 slices whole grain toast with jam
- 1 cup orange juice
- **~800 calories, easily digestible carbs**

## 2 Hours Before Run (5am)
- 1-2 energy bars or 1 cup applesauce
- Sports drink (16-20 oz)
- **~300 calories**

## During Run (20km = ~2 hours)
- Sports drink or electrolyte drink (500ml)
- Energy gels or dates every 5km
- **~300-400 calories**

## Post-Run (within 30 min)
- Smoothie: plant-based protein powder, banana, berries, coconut milk
- Toast with peanut butter
- **~400-500 calories**

## Regular Meals (rest of day)
**Breakfast alternative:** Tofu scramble, hash browns, whole grain toast
**Lunch:** Lentil pasta with vegetables and olive oil
**Dinner:** Chickpea curry with rice and naan
**Snacks:** Nuts, seeds, hummus, fruit, energy bars

---

## Key Points:
✓ Emphasize **refined carbs** (white bread, white rice, pasta) 2-3 days before  
✓ Stay hydrated (3-4L water daily)  
✓ Test all foods during training runs first  
✓ Get adequate protein (~70-80g/day) from legumes, nuts, plant-based protein

                <td class="reasoning">The solution fails to meet all three mandatory requirements. While it demonstrates good understanding of timing and dietary restrictions, it critically lacks: (1) a stated daily caloric total, (2) a macronutrient breakdown with specific numbers, and (3) exact portions for most meals. The vague 'Regular Meals' section with unquantified portions makes it impossible to verify whether the plan actually reaches 5000+ calories or maintains proper macronutrient ratios. The solution provides a framework but not the specific numerical data required by the mandatory criteria.</td>

                <td class="output"><pre># Nutrition Plan for Strength & Muscle Recovery

## Daily Caloric Target
**~2,800-3,000 calories** (slight surplus for muscle building)

## Macronutrient Breakdown

| Macro | Daily Target | Notes |
|-------|---|---|
| **Protein** | 160-170g (1.9-2.0g/kg) | Distributed across 4-5 meals |
| **Carbs** | 350-400g (4.1-4.7g/kg) | Prioritize around training |
| **Fat** | 80-90g (0.94-1.06g/kg) | Essential for hormones |

## Protein Distribution Strategy
Spread intake across meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis:
- **Breakfast:** 30-35g
- **Snack 1:** 25-30g
- **Lunch:** 35-40g
- **Pre/Post-Workout:** 30-40g combined
- **Dinner:** 35-40g

## Best Food Choices

**Protein Sources:** Chicken, beef, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, whey protein

**Carbs:** Oats, rice, potatoes, pasta, whole grain bread, fruit

**Fats:** Olive oil, nuts, avocado, fatty fish, eggs

**Vegetables:** All types (micronutrients + fiber)

## Key Timing Tips
- **Post-workout meal:** Within 1-2 hours (protein + carbs)
- **Pre-workout:** 1-2 hours before (balanced meal)
- **Before bed:** Casein protein or Greek yogurt (slow-digesting)

                <td class="reasoning">The solution violates the mandatory requirement for 'Meals with exact foods, portions, and timing.' While it provides excellent macro targets, protein distribution strategy, and general food recommendations, it stops short of delivering an actual 1-day meal plan. The task explicitly asks for a '1 day meal plan' with specific meals, but the solution only provides a framework and guidelines. The closing question 'Would you like a specific sample meal plan...' confirms the solution is incomplete - it should have included the sample meal plan rather than asking for it. This is a structural failure to meet the core deliverable.</td>

- **Snack**: Dates + hemp seeds
- **Lunch**: Tofu stir-fry + rice + veggies
- **Snack**: Fruit + pumpkin seeds
- **Dinner**: Lentil pasta + tempeh + olive oil
