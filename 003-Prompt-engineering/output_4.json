    "reasoning": "The solution successfully meets all mandatory requirements with clear formatting, exact portions, proper timing, and adherence to dietary restrictions. The macronutrient targets are appropriate for marathon training. However, there is a notable gap in the plan: no in-run fueling strategy for the 2-hour endurance session, which is a significant oversight for marathon training nutrition. Additionally, the total caloric intake is slightly conservative for this athlete's training demands. Despite these secondary deficiencies, the solution provides a well-structured, usable meal plan that covers the core requirements."

The meal plan is well-structured with appropriate timing around training sessions and includes a thoughtful hydration strategy. However, the caloric and protein targets fall meaningfully short of the stated goals for a competitive swimmer with 150 minutes of daily training. The 3,080 kcal plan is approximately 400-500 kcal below what's needed for adequate energy and recovery, which directly impacts the secondary criterion about macronutrient distribution supporting 'high energy expenditure (estimated 3500+ calories).' While the plan is competent and practical, it underestimates the athlete's actual nutritional needs."
