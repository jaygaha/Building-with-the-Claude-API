    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The solution fully satisfies all three mandatory requirements with clear presentation of daily calories, macronutrient percentages, and detailed meals with portions and times. It exceeds the 4-5 meal requirement with 6 eating occasions and demonstrates strong understanding of endurance athlete nutrition. However, the carbohydrate percentage (55-60%) is slightly conservative compared to the 60-70% secondary criterion for glycogen loading, and protein targets are at the minimum acceptable range rather than optimized. The solution is practical, well-organized, and appropriate for the stated goal, but leaves some room for stronger carb-loading emphasis and protein optimization."

Protein distribution is exemplary at 2.36g/kg bodyweight, well within the muscle-building target. However, the solution violates the secondary criterion of containing 4-5 meals by including 6 meals instead. While the content quality is high and the plan is practical, the explicit requirement for 4-5 meals is not met. The word count is acceptable but could be tighter. This is a strong solution with one clear structural violation of stated criteria."

However, there are critical gaps in the mandatory requirement for 'daily caloric total' and 'macronutrient breakdown.' While individual meal macros are listed, the daily totals are not explicitly calculated and presented. The meal totals (650+250+700+300+700+200 = 2,800 cal) align with the lower end of the stated range, but this aggregation should have been explicitly provided. The truncated ending is a minor presentation issue but doesn't affect core content. The plan is otherwise well-structured, practical, and appropriately detailed for the athlete's needs."
