The carbohydrate loading strategy (482g, 60.2% of calories) falls within the 55-65% target range. However, the hydration strategy criterion is only partially satisfied\u2014while a hydration protocol is mentioned, it is incomplete and truncated, failing to provide the specific fluid intake recommendations throughout the day that were explicitly requested. The solution demonstrates strong nutritional planning and formatting but falls short on the secondary criterion due to the incomplete hydration guidance."
