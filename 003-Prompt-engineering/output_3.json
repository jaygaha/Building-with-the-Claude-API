However, it critically fails to provide a complete meal plan for the full day - lunch is truncated and dinner/afternoon snack are missing entirely. Additionally, the task explicitly requests a 'during-run fueling strategy' which is absent from the plan. While the pre-run and post-run nutrition are excellent, the incompleteness and missing during-run strategy represent significant deficiencies in meeting the stated criteria of covering 'breakfast, pre-run meal, during-run fueling strategy, and post-run recovery meal.'"

    "reasoning": "The solution demonstrates strong technical competency in nutritional planning with proper caloric calculations, macro ratios optimized for strength training, and thoughtful lactose-free meal design. However, it fails a MANDATORY requirement by being incomplete. The solution explicitly states it will provide a 'Complete Daily Meal Plan' in Step 4-6 but terminates mid-execution during the post-workout meal section. This prevents verification of: (1) whether all 4+ meals/snacks are actually included, (2) whether protein is properly distributed to meet 1.9g/kg across all meals, and (3) the final daily caloric total. While the framework and methodology are sound, an incomplete meal plan cannot fulfill the core task of providing a 'compact, concise 1 day meal plan' with exact foods, portions, and timing for all meals."
