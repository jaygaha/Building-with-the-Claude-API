## 1. DAILY CALORIE CALCULATION

**Using Mifflin-St Jeor Formula:**
- BMR = 1,669 kcal (sedentary baseline)
- Activity Multiplier: 1.725 (moderate-heavy training)
- **Base Daily Need: ~2,875 kcal**
- **Long run day adjustment: +600 kcal = 3,475 kcal total**

## 2. MACRONUTRIENT BREAKDOWN

| Macro | Amount | Calories |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Carbohydrates** | 550g (63%) | 2,200 kcal |
| **Protein** | 115g (13%) | 460 kcal |
| **Fat** | 97g (25%) | 873 kcal |
| **Fiber** | 35-40g | — |

*Rationale: High carbs support glycogen loading; 1.7g protein/kg for recovery; moderate fat for hormone health*

## 3. WORKOUT TIMING & MEAL STRATEGY

```
6:00 AM  → Pre-run snack (light)
7:00 AM  → 20km run (90 min) + race-pace intervals
8:30 AM  → POST-RUN RECOVERY WINDOW (critical)
9:00 AM  → Breakfast (within 30 min of run)
12:30 PM → Lunch
3:30 PM  → Afternoon Snack
7:00 PM  → Dinner

## 4-5. DETAILED MEAL PLAN

### **PRE-RUN (6:00 AM) - 200 calories**
*Light, easily digestible carbs to top off glycogen*

| Food | Amount | Cals | Carbs | Protein | Fat |
|------|--------|------|-------|---------|-----|
| Banana | 1 medium (120g) | 107 | 27g | 1.3g | 0.3g |

| **TOTAL** | — | **171** | **44g** | **1.3g** | **0.3g** |

💡 *Consume 30-60 min before run*

### **POST-RUN RECOVERY (9:00 AM) - 800 calories**
*4:1 carb-to-protein ratio within 30 min post-run for glycogen replenishment*

| Food | Amount | Cals | Carbs | Protein | Fat |
|------|--------|------|-------|---------|-----|
| Whole grain toast | 3 slices (90g) | 230 | 42g | 9g | 2.7g |
| Almond butter | 2 tbsp (32g) | 190 | 7g | 7g | 16g |
| Scrambled eggs | 2 large (100g) | 155 | 1.1g | 13g | 11g |
| Orange juice | 250ml | 110 | 26g | 2g | 0.2g |

## Step 1: Daily Calorie Calculation

**Using Mifflin-St Jeor Formula + Activity Multiplier**
- BMR = 1,730 calories
- Activity level (heavy training 5-6x/week) = 1.73 multiplier
- **Total Daily Energy Expenditure: ~3,000 calories**
- Surplus for strength gain: +300 calories
- **Target: 3,300 calories/day**

## Step 2: Macronutrient Breakdown

| Macro | Amount | Calories |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Protein** | 190g (0.85g/lb) | 760 cal |
| **Carbs** | 495g (6g/kg) | 1,980 cal |
| **Fat** | 92g (28% of calories) | 828 cal |
| **TOTAL** | | **3,568 cal** |

*Note: Slightly higher to account for tracking variance*

## Step 3: Meal Timing (Assuming 2 PM Workout)

- **6:30 AM** - Breakfast (pre-training prep)
- **9:00 AM** - Mid-morning snack
- **12:00 PM** - Lunch (pre-workout meal)
- **2:00 PM** - **WORKOUT (90 min)**
- **3:30 PM** - Post-workout meal (critical)
- **6:30 PM** - Dinner
- **8:30 PM** - Evening snack (optional)

## 1. DAILY CALORIE CALCULATION

**Athlete Profile:**

- Activity Level: Heavy training + competition prep

**Formula:** BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor) × Activity Factor
- BMR = 10(75) + 6.25(180) - 5(age assumed ~20) + 5 = ~1,700 cal
- Activity multiplier: 1.9 (intense daily training)
- **Total Daily Needs: ~3,200 calories**

## 2. MACRONUTRIENT BREAKDOWN

| Macro | % | Grams | Rationale |
|-------|---|-------|-----------|
| **Protein** | 20% | 160g | Muscle recovery post-swim |
| **Carbs** | 55% | 440g | Glycogen loading for meet |

## 3. MEAL TIMING STRATEGY

**Key Principle:** Light digestion before/after intense swimming

| Time | Goal | Timing |
|------|------|--------|

| **9:30 AM** | Post-workout recovery | 30 min after swim |
