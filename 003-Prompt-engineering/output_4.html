✅ **Timing:** Carbs increased around training windows for performance & recovery

✅ **Whole Foods:** 95% whole foods for micronutrient density

✅ **Budget-Friendly:** Average cost ~$12-15/day (eggs, oats, rice, chicken breast are economical)

✅ **Hydration:** Add 3-4L water daily + electrolytes during training

                <td class="reasoning">The solution comprehensively satisfies all mandatory requirements with precise meal timing, exact portions, and detailed macronutrient tracking. The meal plan covers 6 eating occasions (exceeding the 4-5 requirement) with strategic timing around workouts and sleep. Protein distribution is excellent and well-optimized for muscle building. However, there are notable discrepancies between stated targets and actual macros—carbs and fats both underperform their targets by ~11-12%, which is a secondary criterion issue but indicates calculation or planning inconsistency. The format is compact and clear with helpful notes on hydration and customization. These macro mismatches prevent a perfect score despite meeting all core requirements.</td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution successfully meets all mandatory requirements with clear daily totals, macronutrient breakdowns, exact portions, timing, and lactose-free compliance. The meal plan is well-structured with appropriate timing around training sessions and includes a thoughtful hydration strategy. However, the caloric and protein targets fall meaningfully short of the stated goals for a competitive swimmer with 150 minutes of daily training. The 3,080 kcal plan is approximately 400-500 kcal below what's needed for adequate energy and recovery, which directly impacts the secondary criterion about macronutrient distribution supporting 'high energy expenditure (estimated 3500+ calories).' While the plan is competent and practical, it underestimates the athlete's actual nutritional needs.</td>
