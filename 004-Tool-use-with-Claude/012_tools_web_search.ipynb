Here are the top choices:\\n\\n**1. Barbell Back Squat**\\nOften considered the king of leg exercises, squats target the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. They allow you to lift heavy weights, which is crucial for muscle growth.\\n\\n**2. Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs)**\\nExcellent for targeting the hamstrings and glutes while also working the lower back. They're particularly effective for posterior chain development.\\n\\n**3. Bulgarian Split Squats**\\nA unilateral exercise that helps address muscle imbalances while heavily targeting the quads and glutes. They're also easier on the lower back than traditional squats.\\n\\n**4. Leg Press**\\nAllows you to safely load heavy weight and isolate the legs without taxing the lower back as much as squats. Great for overall leg mass.\\n\\n**5. Lunges (Walking or Stationary)**\\nAnother excellent unilateral movement that works the entire leg and challenges balance and stability.\\n\\n**Key Principles for Leg Muscle Growth:**\\n- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets over time\\n- **Training frequency**: Hit legs 2-3 times per week with adequate recovery\\n- **Rep range**: Mix heavy sets (4-6 reps) with moderate sets (8-12 reps)\\n- **Proper nutrition**: Consume adequate protein (0.7-1g per pound of bodyweight) and calories\\n- **Recovery**: Allow 48-72 hours between intense leg sessions\\n\\nFor most people, building a routine around squats and/or leg press as the primary movement, supplemented with exercises targeting specific muscles (hamstrings, glutes, calves), will yield the best results for overall leg muscle development.\", type='text')], model='claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(cache_creation=CacheCreation(ephemeral_1h_input_tokens=0, ephemeral_5m_input_tokens=0), cache_creation_input_tokens=0, cache_read_input_tokens=0, input_tokens=2228, output_tokens=412, server_tool_use=None, service_tier='standard', inference_geo='not_available'))"
